## Installation

No third-party applications were installed during the making of this website.

## Usage

This website is EXACTLY THE SAME AS ANY OTHER BLOG SITE OUT THERE:
- The user can add, edit, or delete posts
- The user can add, edit, or delete comments
- The user can either login or sign up


## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work: 

1. I had trouble with the JavaScript portion of the project. My colleague, Leo, helped me out a lot. His thoughts are on full display in the script.js file.

2. Just to let you know, this website was used FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. (https://github.com/priyaravi23/mvc-tech-blog) While I used some things to fix my app, I can assure you that this is my own, original work. 

7. I had trouble deploying this app to Heroku. Everything was on there - package.json; even the PORT was 'process.env.port || 3001'. Nothing happened. Then, when I talked to Professor Maddatu, everything was fixed. So thank you Professor!
